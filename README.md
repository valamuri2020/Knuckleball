# Knuckleball  

Over the last few summers, I noticed that we've had fewer and fewer games each year. Why? What could possibly be more enticing than a thrilling match of close calls, dives, saves and skills? Turns out, it's fantasy soccer.  So now, the key was to bring a new aspect of competition, rewards and progress system into the real world. In order to make real soccer more like a "game," I needed to develop a method to "game-ify" this game. That's why Knuckleball - an easy way to track your progress, compare and compete with friends, and most of all, stay active! 

#### Features
* A RESTful API, built with Express and NodeJS, is used to access user data, add users, update statisitcs, and revisit previous games
* Implemented YouTube API to provide video suggestions for training by identifying player weaknesses in data
* Designed a responsive user interface using React and Bootstrap to display user statistics, videos, manage track record and view performance statistics
* Expressed user growth with Chart.js by accessing user data stored in a MonogDB database
