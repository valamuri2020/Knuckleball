# Knuckleball  
A web application built using the MERN stack to helps young soccer players keep track of their soccer statistics.

### Inspiration
Over the last four summers, I noticed that we had less and less soccer games at the community park. Why? What could possibly be more enticing than a thrilling match of close calls, dives, saves and skills? Turns out, it's fantasy soccer.  So now the key was to bring a new aspect of competition, rewards and progress system into the real world. In order to make real soccer more like a "game," I needed to develop a method to "game-ify" this game. That's why Knuckleball - an easy way to track your progress, compare and compete with friends, and most of all, stay active!
